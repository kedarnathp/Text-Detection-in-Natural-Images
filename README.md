# Text-Detection-in-Natural-Images
CS200 B.Tech Minor Project (Jan 2017- Apr 2017)


1. Recommended to read the Report under 'master' branch to know about the project in detail.

2. Programming software/tools for Implementation : MATLAB version-R2014b

3. The Algorithm(MSER based) that we used for detecting the text is Robust in case of plain texture background but "fails" in case if the background in the images is complex (like scenic). 
Using Deep learning techniques would be a better approach in case of those images (for example : test3.jpg, test4.png images in test images folder where our algorithm fails).
